  <h1>React Native component for Bambuser broadcasting SDK</h1>
</div>

## Requirements

Version `0.0.9` and above of this React Native component requires React Native `0.60` or higher.

## Installation

1. Add `react-native-bambuser-broadcaster` to your React Native project.  
    `$ yarn add react-native-bambuser-broadcaster --save`
2. Android SDK from https://dashboard.bambuser.com/developer
3. Android only: Head over to https://bambuser.com/docs/broadcasting/android/ and follow the Android sections [Add the broadcast SDK](https://bambuser.com/docs/broadcasting/android/#add-the-broadcast-sdk) and [Add required Android app permissions and features](https://bambuser.com/docs/broadcasting/android/#add-required-android-app-permissions-and-features) for the Android project within your React Native project.
    **Important note:** when adding the libbambuser subproject, make sure you name it **libbambuser**, the React Native component will look for this subproject when building your React Native app.
4. iOS only: Go to https://bambuser.com/docs/broadcasting/ios-objc/ and follow the sections [Installing dependencies using CocoaPods](https://bambuser.com/docs/broadcasting/ios-objc/#install-dependencies-using-cocoapods).


### To automatically link this React Native module to your Xcode/Android projects run the following command:

If you are using React Native `0.60` or above run: `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`.
If you are using an older version of React Native please refer back to README.md in this repository for specific version.


### If you want to manually add this React Native module to your Xcode/Android Studio projects, then follow these steps:


For Xcode:
1. In Xcode, in the project navigator, right click the `Libraries` directory, and choose `Add Files to your [your projects name]`.
2. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-bambuser-broadcaster` and add `RNBambuserBroadcaster.xcodeproj`.
3. In Xcode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNBambuserBroadcaster.a` to your projects `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`.


For Android:
1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/.../MainActivity.java`.
2. Add `import com.bambuserbroadcaster.BambuserBroadcasterViewPackage` to the imports at the top.
3. Add `new BambuserBroadcasterViewPackage()` to the return array in the `getPackages()` method. Your `getPackages()` method should look something like this:  
    ```java
    ...
    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
        return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
            new MainReactPackage(),
            new BambuserBroadcasterViewPackage()
        );
    }
    ...
    ```

4. Add the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:  
    ```
    include ':react-native-bambuser-broadcaster'
    project(':react-native-bambuser-broadcaster').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-bambuser-broadcaster/android')
    ```

5. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:  
    ```
    compile project(':react-native-bambuser-broadcaster')
    ```


## Usage

In order to use this React Native component and our SDKs you'll need to generate an `applicationId` over at https://dashboard.bambuser.com/developer.

```javascript
import RNBambuserBroadcaster from 'react-native-bambuser-broadcaster';

...
<RNBambuserBroadcaster applicationId={yourApplicationId} />
```

### Props
```javascript
applicationId: String
// This applicationId should be fetched from your backend, rather than being hardcoded within your Reacty Native app. Read more here https://bambuser.com/docs/key-concepts/application-id/

audioQuality: String
// RNBambuserBroadcaster.AUDIO_QUALITY.HIGH || RNBambuserBroadcaster.AUDIO_QUALITY.LOW || RNBambuserBroadcaster.AUDIO_QUALITY.MUTE

author: String
// Populates the author field in your broadcasts metadata.

title: String
// Populates the title field in your broadcasts metadata.

customData: Object
// Populates the customData field in your broadcasts metadata.

localCopy: Boolean
// If you set this to true the next broadcast will also be saved to the broadcasting device.

localCopyFilename: String
// If localCopy is true, then you can choose to set a specific name for the output file on this broadcast. If you don't provide a localCopyFilename then the output filename will have a automatically generated value.

sendPosition: Boolean
// This prop decides if the broadcasters location should be sent on the next broadcast.

saveOnServer: Boolean
// Set this prop to false if you do not want to save the next broadcast online.

zoom: Number
// Provide a value between 0(no zoom) and 1(maximum zoom).

talkback: Boolean
// Set false if you don't want to allow the talkback feature for your broadcast.

### Controlling the broadcaster
By storing a reference to the RNBambuserBroadcaster you can call its functions.

```javascript
<RNBambuserBroadcaster
ref={ref => {this.myBroadcasterRef = ref; }} applicationId={yourApplicationId} />
```

The available functions for RNBambuserBroadcaster can be called are:
```javascript
this.myBroadcasterRef.startBroadcast();
// Call this when you want to start broadcasting. This will trigger the callback onBroadcastStarted when the broadcast starts.

this.myBroadcasterRef.stopBroadcast();
// Call this when you want to stop broadcasting. This will trigger the callback onBroadcastStopped when the broadcast stopped.

this.myBroadcasterRef.switchCamera();
// Call this when you want switch which camera your device is broadcasting from.

this.myBroadcasterRef.takePicture();
// Call this when you want to take a picture of ongoing broadcast. This will trigger the callback onPictureSaved when the image is ready.

this.myBroadcasterRef.startUplinkTest();
// Call this if you want to start an uplink test. When this is finished the callback of onUplinkTestComplete is invoked.

this.myBroadcasterRef.acceptTalkback(talkbackId);
// If you want to accept an incoming talkback request, then you call this function with the talkbackId provided from onIncomingTalkbackRequest.

this.myBroadcasterRef.declineTalkback(talkbackId);
// If you want to decline an incoming talkback request, then you call this function with the talkbackId provided from onIncomingTalkbackRequest.

this.myBroadcasterRef.endTalkback();
// If you want to end the currently ongoing talkback session, then call this function.
```
